Stocking Presidents

Hypothesis – If the president influences the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days, measured from election day to inauguration and total term of each President, would be greater than the market historical average from January 3, 2000 to September 27, 2019.

Null Hypothesis – If the president does not influence the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days, measured from election day to inauguration and total term of each President, would be equal to the market historical average from January 3, 2000 to September 27, 2019.

Our group investigated three questions:
1. Does the U.S. President have an impact on the stock market?
2. Is there a difference between the frequency of positive or negative days when comparing presidents?
3. What are the changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average from election to inauguration and within a president's term?

Conclusion: Based on our data, we failed to reject the null-hypothesis, which was: If the President of the United States does not influence the stock market, we would expect the frequency of positive and negative close days, measured from election to inauguration and by total term of each President, to be equal to the market historical average.

This repository is from a group project and contains the working documents - Jupyter Notebooks using Python and APIs to pull the the data, the powerpoint presentation, etc. 

I took the results of this project and created a website in my respository called  web-design-challenge. My website can be viewed at:
