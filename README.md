Stocking Presidents

Hypothesis – If the president influences the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days, measured from election day to inauguration and total term of each President, would be greater than the market historical average from January 3, 2000 to September 27, 2019.

Null Hypothesis – If the president does not influence the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days, measured from election day to inauguration and total term of each President, would be equal to the market historical average from January 3, 2000 to September 27, 2019.

Our group investigated three questions:
1. Does the U.S. President have an impact on the stock market?
2. Is there a difference between the frequency of positive or negative days when comparing presidents?
3. What are the changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average from election to inauguration and within a president's term?
